 A simple demo to illustrate the react way of conditional rendering the DOM.

A simple 'Grid' having repetitive 'Cell' component in it.

- on choosing any color and clicking on  cell will change the background
- 'shuffle' will shuffle the cells in any order, the cell number must stick to their background color after shuffle
- 'reset' will restore the initial configuration
